She is busy making the German version of Baywatch, an American TV programme about lifeguards, which is being filmed in Majorca. One week later, the scene is still a sun-drenched beach, but now I'm in Cornwall, England. This time, I'm not on holiday, but on a lifeguard's course. With any luck, and lots of physically demanding work, in just a few days I will be a fully qualified, much-admired lifeguard. As I was expecting rain and a howling gale, this was April - I was slightly surprised by the brilliant sunshine. Even so, I did not look forward to the prospect of going into the chilly ocean.",
