She puts on a greasy apron, rolls up her sleeves and gets ready for the day's work.<br><br>The first customer pulls up in an old van. It has a flat tyre and the driver was lucky to make it to the garage. Noreen puts on her rubber gloves and gets down to work. She casually pulls off the wheel, swings it onto the work bench with one hand and takes it apart. 'There's your problem, sir,' she announces, pointing at a tiny hole in the tyre. Right now, he couldn't care less about that, since what he feels is more serious: a fast-decreasing sense of his own worth. At least his mates haven't come to witness him being rescued by a sweet-faced granny!",

It's a family business and when Noreen's husband died, she decided to keep it going for her two sons, Bill and Fred, then aged only seventeen and fifteen. Before that, her husband had let her watch what went on in the garage, but she had never been allowed to lift a finger. Initially, she doubted her ability to make a go of it, but somehow she managed, and although the boys are now grown up, has never got round to handing over.",

So much so, that on the rare occasions when she does go away, she can't wait to return. 'I have just had a wonderful holiday on board a cruise ship. Going to sea made sure I couldn't come running back to the garage after a few hours! But walking back into the garage meant coming home to me,' she says fondly.",
